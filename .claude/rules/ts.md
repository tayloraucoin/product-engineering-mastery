# TypeScript

Only the rules a capable model would not apply by default. Full contract: `docs/engineering/codebase-conventions.md`.

- Named exports; a default export only where Next.js or a config file requires one.
- Kebab-case file names; verb-first function names (`getAllDocs`, `resolveDocLink`); no `helpers`, `misc` or `utils.ts` catch-alls.
- Import workspaces as `@pem/<name>`, never by relative path across a package. `yarn lint:boundaries` enforces the layer graph; never suppress it.
- `@pem/ui` exposes one subpath per component (`@pem/ui/button`), not a barrel; a new component adds its own `exports` entry.
- Server Components by default; `"use client"` on line 1 of a leaf, placed by its importers.
- `process.env` is read only in an app's `env.ts`, created by the first variable.
- `tooling/*.ts` runs directly on Node 22 with type stripping: no enums, no parameter properties, no `namespace`; import with explicit `.ts` extensions.
